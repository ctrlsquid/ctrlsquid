# Hi there! 

My name is Zach, aka ctrl squid, aka sneaky crow. I'm a passionate software developer with several decades of experience. I'm a lover of FOSS, video games, guitars, and community. 

You'll catch me contributing to most of my projects on [sneakycrow][sneakycrow-org], where I host public FOSS as well as closed source private projects. If you're interested in working with me, please email me! You can find all my details on [my website][website].
